# SpringProjects

Hi, this is a simple spring boot project to display covid19 cases india using httpClient and thymeleaf to render the data on the browser.

This project not only fetches the covid cases in india but also from around the world.

Sources used to fetch the data
Covid data worldwide-> https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19

Covid data specific to India -> https://github.com/covid19india/api

I have used to types of method to fetch the data,
-For Worldwide data, the data is received in the CSV format.
-For Indian data, the data received in Json format.


In this project i have also tried to fetch data regarding Vaccination status.Right now you can fetch the vaccination data by Pincode.

For vaccination data there is no view. You can use an API client like Postman/Insomnia to fetch the data.

Please feel free add more to it.
